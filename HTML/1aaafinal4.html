<h2>Marketing</h2>
<p>I don't think Medecins Sans Frontieres is popular. 
  So, I'm thinking to make SNS ads to let people know what is Medecins Sans Frontieres.
  And how they can involved to help others.
</p>

<h2>Missing map making</h2>
<p>Since Medecins Sans Frontieres is going to the villages in wild a lot, 
  that villages are not in map in many times. So, it is important to make a map 
for the people who is coming next.
