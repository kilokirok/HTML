<h2>Why MSF</h2>
<p>While doing missionary work, I saw people in California and Korea, where I thought there would not be many people who could not receive treatment, who could not receive proper medical treatment due to financial difficulties. It was hard to imagine how many people were suffering in developing countries. MSF is an organization of the medical people who wants to help those people.</p>

<h2>What MSF do?</h2>
<p>Médecins Sans Frontières brings medical 
  humanitarian assistance to victims of conflict, 
  natural disasters, epidemics or healthcare exclusion.</p>

<h2>Where are them</h2>
<p>In more than 70 countries, 
  Médecins Sans Frontières provides 
  medical humanitarian assistance 
  to save lives and ease the suffering 
  of people in crisis situations.</p>
