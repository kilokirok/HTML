  <div class="pa">Create a new HTML page and a new linked CSS file.
    <br> You may copy your own code from any previous assignment.
    <br>
    Create a responsive page layout using @media query breakpoints that resemble the three examples below. 
    <br>The page should contain Header, Navigation, Main Content, Aside and a Footer areas.
    <br>The white section in the middle is the "content area" and you should have multiple paragraphs worth of text (dummy text is ok for this assignment).
    <br> You must include at least one image in the content area that has the "float" property. The image must have an ALT attribute.
    <br>You must include a navigation section with links as shown. (The links don't necessarily have to take the user anywhere.) The links should be in a list format.
     
    <br>
    It is recommended you design for "mobile first" as it is the simplest layout.
    <br> Then work your way up to the wider designs.<br>
    <br>There is no universal standard of where to but your breakpoints, but here is a rough guideline:<br>
    Mobile (Phones): max-width: 600px (setting this to max-width catches everything below.)<br>
    480px is a more common breakpoint for mobile, but use 600 here so its easier to work with in class.
    Tablets: min-width: 600px<br>
    Desktops: min-width: 768px (setting this to min-width catches everything above.)<br>
    Note: You may choose to attach separate CSS files for the different sizes.</div>
