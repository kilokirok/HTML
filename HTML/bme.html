<p class="f"> My most enjoyable experience here at BYUH was swimming at the beach. Since I have just finished my mission in July, it has been a while since I swam. So, I really enjoyed that. I went to Hukilau beach. That beach was really beautiful, and the sand was really soft.</p>

<p class="s">There are several things that foreign students in Korea are going to experience especially culture shock in Korea. First, I want to talk about the delivery system. The delivery system in Korea is really fast and deliver everything. A lot of foreigner missionaries I met loved it. Second, Korea is safe even at late night. Korea has a lot of streetlamps and CCTVs. So, a lot of people can hang out even if over midnight no matter what age and gender are they. I’m sure that there are things that foreign student could bad experience culture shocks, but I think culture shocks are not only bad things but also there are good things.</p>

<p class="t">There are several reasons that why I think I’m more ethnocentric than xenocentric. First, even though I try to understand other people’s culture, I’m surprised when other people are doing something that is not common in my culture. For example, we usually hug female friends only during special times. When someone leave for a long time or when we meet again a long time later, we are going to hug them. I understand that people act normal in their culture which are not bad behavior, however, I still feel surprised. Second, I'm fitting other people in my culture. I’m trying to accept people as people and trying to understand their own meanings of their behaviors, but it is hard to do that. I believe the things that I wrote here are the things that I can overcome over time.</p>
