<p>It was Jesus Christ who had the greatest influence on my education. One of the characteristics of Jesus Christ is great knowledge. He excelled in everything and many people tried to beat him, but he couldn't. In addition, one of his church, Jesus Christ's Late Saints, is to receive sufficient education for the future family, and the church provides sufficient opportunities and help for it.
